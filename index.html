  <section id="abstract">
    <p>Currently, the Solid protocol and its specifications lack the terms to express metadata related to the entities, roles, processes or infrastructure necessary to provide transparency to its data handling practices. In particular, these specifications do not have the terms to deal with the obligations and requirements brought by regulations related to (personal) data protection and privacy. The establishment of a metadata language such as PLASMA enables this by providing consistent taxonomies to describe the entities (e.g., providers, developers), the infrastructure, legal roles, policies, notices, registries and logs necessary to understand and establish responsibilities and accountability within the Solid ecosystem.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>PLASMA aims to provide a set of taxonomies to express Solid-related use-cases in terms of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>What?</em> i.e. the data in question</li>
      <li><em>Who?</em> i.e. who&#39;s data and who is requesting/using/providing it</li>
      <li><em>Where?</em> i.e. where the data is coming from, where it will be stored and where is it going</li>
      <li><em>Why?</em> i.e. for what purpose is the data being requested/used/shared?</li>
      <li><em>When?</em> i.e. over what temporal duration is the data being requested/used/shared?</li>
      <li><em>How?</em> i.e. how is this being done, by what means and technologies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to specifying a taxonomy of different types of policies, PLASMA promotes the usage of ODRL and DPV to determine access control to Solid Pod's resources and provides examples for <a href="#using-policies">using said policies</a>.</p>
    <p>PLASMA also provides the conditions for Pods, apps, services, users and agents to be <a href="#conformance">conformant</a> with this specification, as well as different <a href="#using-policies">workflows</a> scenarios where the terms here defined are used, e.g., get a Pod, add data to a Pod, create policies or auditing apps. Finally, a <a href="#legal-compliance">legal compliance</a> section was specified to describe how PLASMA terms can be related with data protection laws such as the GDPR and what is missing and needs to be considered.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="vocab">
    <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
    <p>PLASMA aims to provide a set of taxonomies to represent the most relevant concepts for representing information regarding the what, who, where, why, when and how data is being handled in the Solid ecosystem.</p>
    <p>The <a href="#base">Base concepts</a> correspond to the core entities and infrastructure necessary to ensure accountability in the Solid ecosystem, namely the providers and developers of Solid Pods, apps, or services. In addition, a taxonomy of <a href="#policies">Policies</a> and <a href="#agreements">Agreements</a> is provided to establish usage preferences and requirements of Solid users, as well as to establish data requests and record data agreements in a machine-readable format.</p>
    <p>The <a href="#entities">Entities</a> section provides a set of terms to describe the providers and developers of infrastructure, apps, services and identity, specifies different users in regards with their ability to interact with data, and describes agents as virtual entities that act of behalf of users, apps and services. <a href="#notices">Notices</a> can be provided to describe these entities data handling activities.</p>
    <p>A taxonomy of <a href="#services">Services</a> is also provided as this is a new concept introduced in the Solid ecosystem by PLASMA. The idea is to separate apps from other functionalities that might not be needed to be packaged as such, e.g., an identity verification service that checks the validity of identity certificates. A <a href="#data">Data</a> taxonomy is also specified to describe logs and metadata of data related with users, apps, services, and registries.</p>

    <section id="base">
      <h3>Base concepts</h3>
      <p>PLASMA relies on (and expands) the existing Solid specifications to specify its core concepts regarding providers, developers, Pods, apps or services. Later, these concepts are expanded into taxonomies of entities, policies, services, notices, and data.</p>

        </center>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><code>App</code>: An application that stores, collects, uses, shares, erases, or performs other actions on <code>Data</code> with the aim of providing specific purposes, services, or functionalities, e.g., a Contact Address Book or a Chess Game. An application can use several <code>Services</code> and requires human intervention.</li>
        <div class="note">In the <a href="https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/" target="_blank">Solid Application Interoperability</a> specification, an <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/interop#Application" target="_blank">application</a> is defined as "a software-based Agent that a Social Agent uses to access, manipulate, and manage the data in their control, as well as the data they've been granted access to". This definition is compatible with the one provided for the same concept in the <a href="https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol#solid-app" target="_blank">Solid Protocol</a> specification. However, in PLASMA we do not specify Apps as a subclass of agents as both previously mentioned specifications do. Instead, as specified later on, PLASMA has the concept of <code>AppAgent</code> which specifies a type of agent that acts on behalf of an App.</div>
        <li><code>Service</code>: A functionality that may or may not utilise or interact with <code>Data</code> within a <code>Pod</code>. For example, an Identity Verification service that checks the validity of certificates, or a Query service that retrieves contacts matching the filter. A service can be associated with an <code>App</code> or a <code>Pod</code> and may not require human intervention, e.g. executing in the background. Services represent an abstraction of functionality that does not necessarily have to be <i>packaged</i> as an <code>App</code>. For example, <code>Users</code> can choose services to run on their <code>Pods</code>, with the services having their own <code>Developers</code> and <code>Providers</code>.
          <div class="note" title="exploratory concept">We envision service as being something that does not require the full metadata and agent-based identification and authorisation as an App. The exact mechanism for this as well as workflows for how it should be initiated and used have not been explored yet. We specify this concept to denote the possibility of having services separate from apps.</div>
        </li>
        <li><code>Pod</code>: A Personal Data Store or a &#39;Pod&#39; that conforms to the Solid specifications.</li>
        <div class="note">In the <a href="https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol" target="_blank">Solid Protocol</a> specification, a <a href="https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol#data-pod" target="_blank">Pod</a> is defined as "a place for storing documents, with mechanisms for controlling who can access what". This definition is compatible with the one provided for the same concept in the <a href="https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/" target="_blank">Solid Application Interoperability</a> specification, however, none of the Solid vocabularies provides this term.</div>
        <li><code>Agent</code>: A virtual entity associated with carrying out actions within or related to a <code>Pod</code> or its <code>Data</code>.</li>
        <div class="note">Both the <a href="https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol" target="_blank">Solid Protocol</a> and <a href="https://solidproject.org/TR/wac" target="_blank">Web Access Control</a> specifications define an <a href="https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol#agent" target="_blank">agent</a> as a "person, social entity, or software identified by a URI; e.g., a WebID denotes an agent". The <a href="https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/" target="_blank">Solid Application Interoperability</a> specification goes one step further by making a distinction between agents and <a href="https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/#social-agent" target="_blank">social agents</a>, where the latter is defined as a "strongly identifiable individual, group, or organization that can own or be responsible for data, and provide authorization to the access of that data by other Agents".</div>
        <li><code>Policy</code>: A set of guidelines or decisions or recommendations governing the use of <code>Pod</code> or its <code>Data</code>.</li>
        <li><code>Entity</code>: A legally recognised entity. Legally recognised means the entity has some recognition as being able to enter into agreements, has an address for accountability, is responsible for obligations, rights, etc. Entities are associated with <code>Apps</code>, <code>Services</code> or <code>Pods</code>.</li>
        <li><code>Data</code>: Data stored on a <code>Pod</code> or associated with <code>User</code>, <code>App</code>, <code>Service</code>, or <code>DataSubject</code> of a <code>Pod</code>.</li>
        <li><code>Provider</code>: An <code>Entity</code> that <i>provides</i> some <i>thing</i> such as a <code>Pod</code>, <code>SolidPlatform</code>, <code>App</code>, <code>Service</code>, or <code>Data</code>.</li>
        <li><code>Developer</code>: An <code>Entity</code> that <i>develops</i> some <i>thing</i> such as a <code>Pod</code>, <code>SolidPlatform</code>, <code>App</code>, or <code>Service</code>.</li>
        <li><code>Customer</code>: An <code>Entity</code> that <i>has a business relationship</i> with others entities to use <code>Pod</code>s or related resources (e.g., purchasing, leasing, subscribing, or establishing any form of contract or agreement for the use of Solid <code>Pod</code>s or its related resources, with or without monetary transactions).</li>
        <li><code>SolidPlatform</code>: The specific implementation of Solid that is installed or used within a <code>Pod</code>.</li>
        <li><code>SolidSpecification</code>: The specification that the <code>Pod</code> conforms to in terms of defining the terms, behaviour, and implementation details regarding <code>Pods</code> and their association with <code>Services</code> and <code>Apps</code>.</li>

      <h3>Entities</h3>
      <p>Currently, Solid vocabularies do not provide terms to describe entities beyond the existing predicates in the WAC [] and ACP [] vocabularies to describe access conditions for agents, client applications or identity issuers. In PLASMA, we provide the terms to describe the providers and/or developers of Solid apps, services, and other Solid-related infrastructure, as well as terms to describe different types of users and agents.</p>

        </center>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>InfrastructureProvider</code>: The <code>Provider</code> of infrastructure - such as storage, computing, network, domain names. The term infrastructure has a very specific and restricted meaning and should not be confused with other terms such as <code>Services</code> (e.g. analytics, querying) or <code>Apps</code> (e.g. data use dashboards).</li>
        <li><code>PodProvider</code>: The <code>Provider</code> of a <code>Pod</code>. Here the term <em>provider</em> refers to an entity that provisions the <code>Pod</code>, i.e. creates the necessary infrastructure, platform, and software so that the <code>Pod</code> can be used by the <code>User</code>.</li>
        <li><code>PodDeveloper</code>: The <code>Developer</code> of a <code>Pod</code>. The developer may not be the provider, in which case this term will differ from <code>PodProvider</code>. </li>
        <li><code>SolidPlatformProvider</code>: The <code>Provider</code> of a <code>SolidPlatform</code>. Here the term <em>provider</em> refers to an entity that provisions the <code>SolidPlatform</code>, i.e. creates the necessary infrastructure, platform, and software so that the <code>SolidPlatform</code> can be used by the <code>User</code>.</li>
        <li><code>SolidPlatformDeveloper</code>: The <code>Developer</code> of a <code>SolidPlatform</code>. The developer may not be the provider, in which case this term will differ from <code>SolidPlatformProvider</code>. </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Applications</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>AppDeveloper</code>: The <code>Developer</code> of an <code>App</code>. Developer here refers to the entity that developed the <code>App</code>, rather than individual members or units within the entity. For example, Firefox has Mozilla as the developer.</li>
        <li><code>AppProvider</code>: The <code>Provider</code> of an <code>App</code>. Here the term <em>provider</em> refers to the entity that enables that <code>App</code> to be accessed and used. The provider may not be the developer, in which case this term will differ from <code>AppDeveloper</code>. Examples include directly using an <code>App</code> from the developer&#39;s website (developer is same as provider), or using an <code>App</code> through an App Store or a common marketplace (developer is different from provider). For example, Firefox can be directly downloaded from its website, or via package management, or come pre-installed on a system.</li>
        <div class="note">
          The Solid Application Interoperability specification defines that an application should have an <a href="https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/#application-profile-document" target="_blank">application profile document</a> which is defined as a "linked data document obtained by dereferencing the URI for a given application identity". This document should be publicly readable (example below retrieved from the specification). In addition, this specification makes a distinction between <a href="https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/#security-appauthz" target="_blank">strongly and weakly identifiable applications</a>.

      <p><strong>Services</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>ServiceDeveloper</code>: The <code>Developer</code> of a <code>Service</code>. Developer here refers to the entity that developed the <code>Service</code>, rather than individual members or units within the entity.</li>
        <li><code>ServiceProvider</code>: The <code>Provider</code> of a <code>Service</code>.

Examples include directly using a <code>Service</code> from the developer&#39;s website (developer is same as provider), or using a <code>Service</code> through a Service Store or a common marketplace (developer is different from provider).</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Identity</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>IdentityProvider</code>: The <code>Provider</code> of an identity service or credential. Here provider means the entity that provisions the identity mechanism. For example, the <code>PodProvider</code> also provides an identity credential for use with the <code>Pod</code>.</li>
        <div class="note">The <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#" target="_blank">Solid terms vocabulary</a> includes an <code>oidcIssuer</code> predicate to denote <a href="https://solid.github.io/webid-profile/#identity-provider" target="_blank">"a Solid OIDC Identity Provider capable of authenticating the WebID owner"</a>. Beyond that, no metadata is provided regarding the identity of the provider.</div>
        <li><code>IdentityDeveloper</code>: The <code>Developer</code> of an identity service or credential. The developer may be different from a provider, in which case this term will differ from <code>IdentityProvider</code>. For example, a <code>PodProvider</code> uses an existing certificate creation service to provide certificates, in which case the developer would be the entity that created the certificate, while the <code>PodProvider</code> would be the provider for the identity.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Users</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>User</code>: User of a <code>Pod</code> that can read, write, edit, erase data on a <code>Pod</code>. There may be multiple <code>User</code>s for a single <code>Pod</code>. Users can have limited permissions or abilities to interact with <code>Data</code>, for example - <code>ReadUser</code> that can only read or view data, or <code>WriteUser</code> that can only write or edit existing data.</li>
        <li><code>DataSubject</code>: The subject of <code>Data</code> within a <code>Pod</code>. The <code>User</code> may not always be the <code>DataSubject</code>. There may be multiple <code>Subject</code>s for a single <code>Pod</code>.</li>
        <li><code>PodAdmin</code>: User of a <code>Pod</code> that has <i>administrative</i> capability to make decisions about the <code>Pod</code> (separate from <code>Data</code> in a <code>Pod</code>), such as deleting the <code>Pod</code>, changing identity or other resource providers, or other controls and decisions related to the use and maintainence of <code>Pods</code>.</li>
        <li><code>AdminUser</code>: User of a <code>Pod</code> that has <i>administrative</i> capability to make decisions about <code>Data</code> on a <code>Pod</code>. The administration can scoped, such as being limited to specific data paths/categories, or can be global, i.e. applicable to all <code>Data</code> in the <code>Pod</code>.</li>
        <div class="note">Currently, Solid vocabularies do not make a distinction between different types of users. The term <code>owner</code> is used in several Solid specifications but not always with the same meaning. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/terms#" target="_blank">Solid terms vocabulary</a> is currently debating adding the concept <code>owner</code> to refer to the entity that has <code>acl:control</code> access to an entire storage. The <a href="https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol" target="_blank">Solid Protocol</a> provides an informal extension of this definition by adding that an owner is "a person or a social entity that is considered to have the rights and responsibilities of a data storage" and "is set at storage provisioning time and can be changed". However, this term is problematic in that it may get interpreted as referring to <i>data ownership</i> which is a specific legally relevant concept, and may produce unintended applications in terms of copyright and intellectual property rights. It also creates issues through use of <i>responsibilities</i> which are based on legal obligations and rights, and which do not necessarily fall upon the individuals.</div>

      <p><strong>Agents</strong></p>
      <p>Agents are entities that can act, whether by themselves (e.g. users), or on behalf or behest of other entities. They can be real (e.g. people, parents on behalf of children) or virtual (e.g. software agent). For Solid, we use <i>Agent</i> here to refer to the virtual agents so as to distinguish them from <i>Entity</i> which represents real or legal entities (i.e. those that can be held accountable).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>UserAgent</code>: An <code>Agent</code> acting on behalf of the <code>User</code>. For example, a <code>Service</code> running or managed by the <code>Pod</code> that assists the <code>User</code> by matching the <code>DataRequest</code> with <code>UserPreferences</code> and <code>UserRequirements</code>.</li>
        <li><code>AppAgent</code>: An <code>Agent</code> acting on behalf of an <code>App</code>. For example, an <code>Agent</code> that organizes an inbox application by email priority. </li>
        <li><code>ServiceAgent</code>: An <code>Agent</code> acting on behalf of a <code>Service</code>. For example, an <code>Agent</code> that syncs data stored in a Pod with another Pod.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">The Solid Application Interoperability specification defines a specific type of application - an <a href="https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/#authorization-agent" target="_blank">authorisation agent</a> - appointed by a "Social Agent to be responsible for managing the access to data under their control" via registries. This definition is too narrow as a user might want to manage their pod data using other types of services or entities. Further details on the identity of this agent are currently missing.</div>

    <section id="policies">
      <h3>Policies</h3>
      <p>In the context of Solid, policies are documents used to specify the requirements of users, apps and services regarding data handling practices over data stored or shared through Solid Pods.</p>
      <div>
        <center>
          <img src="./img/policies.png" alt="PLASMA's policy concepts" width="600px">
        </center>
      </div>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Note that these definitions are not limited to the data on Pod - this is intentional. Otherwise the policy will only relate to what is happening on the Pod, but not what happens after that. For example, to avoid cases such as to collect data for purpose X and then later decide to also perform purpose Y on it. This is to align the descriptions with legal requirements such as stating all purposes at the time of data collection, or going back and asking again for a new purpose.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><code>DataRequest</code>: Request from an <code>App</code>, <code>Service</code>, <code>Agent</code> or <code>User</code> to store, collect, use, share, erase, or perform other actions on <code>Data</code>. </li>
        <li><code>AppManifest</code>: Manifest from an <code>App</code> including information regarding startup parameters, identity, privacy policies and <code>DataRequests</code>. </li>
        <div class="note">While the W3C currently has a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/" target="_blank">Web Application Manifest</a> specification on the standardisation track, by itself it should not be considered sufficient for an App's Manifest in the context of Solid Pods. We envision the necessity to include metadata in the Manifest to denote information such as: entities, policies, identifiers, etc. -- related to accountability and legal compliance.</div>
        <li><code>ServiceManifest</code>: Manifest from a <code>Service</code> including metadata, <code>Apps</code> using the service and information regarding <code>DataRequests</code>. </li>
        <li><code>UserPreference</code>: Preference of a <code>User</code> regarding purposes, entities, and other actions on <code>Data</code>. A preference is a soft rule that may not be satisfied, e.g. when the user's preferences do not match the app's, the user can still decide to accept the stated purposes.</li>
        <li><code>UserRequirement</code>: Requirements of a <code>User</code> regarding purposes, entities, and other actions on <code>Data</code>. A requirement is a hard rule that should always be satisfied, e.g. the user requirement is to never share something - then even if the user accepts the stated request, this should not be allowed. One-time exceptions, or changing the rule, are solutions to get around this. But the intention is to create a barrier.</li>
        <li><code>UserOffer</code>: An offer from the <code>User</code> of a <code>Pod</code> regarding purposes, entities, and actions on <code>Data</code>. For example, the <code>User</code> expresses an <code>UserOffer</code> that their <code>ServiceUsageStatistics</code> as a category of <code>Data</code> is available for <code>Research</code> as a <code>Purpose</code> but only by <code>NonProfitEntity</code> (e.g. Universities), and with the requirement that it follows a specific <code>Law</code> (e.g. GDPR).</li>
        <li><code>DataAgreement</code>: An agreement regarding purposes, entities, and actions on <code>Data</code>. For example, stating that the <code>User</code> has given <code>Consent</code> to an <code>App</code> to <code>Collect</code>, <code>Store</code>, and <code>Use</code> some <code>Data</code> for a <code>Purpose</code>. Or, stating that the <code>User</code> has accepted that their <code>Data</code> will be <code>Collect</code>ed and <code>Use</code>d for a providing a <code>Service</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <section id="agreements">
        <h3>Agreements</h3>
        <p>An Agreement is a document that describes an arrangement between entities. In the context of Solid, an <code>AppAgreement</code>, <code>ServiceAgreement</code> or <code>PodAgreement</code> can be governed by a contract between the <code>User</code> and the entity responsible for the <code>App</code>, <code>Service</code> or <code>Pod</code>, or can be based on the <code>UserConsent</code>.</p>
        <div class="note">Currently, the Solid specifications do not include any information on such agreements - only resources related to authorised accesses are established between Users and Apps in the form of <i> ACL authorisations</i> or <i>ACP access grants</i>.</div>

    <h2>Using Policies</h2>
    <p>Currently, Solid has two specifications to determine access authorisations to resources in Solid Pods.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Web Access Control (WAC)</b> specification: IRIs are used to represent resources and agents, and authorisation statements are stored within Access Control Lists (ACLs) defined per resource or inherited from the parent resource.</li>
      <li><b>Access Control Policy (ACP)</b> specification: access grants are provided to certain resources and agents based on an <code>acp:Context</code> that describes the agent's request for data and the access control resources (ACRs) that describe who is allowed or denied access to Pod resources using <code>acp:Matcher</code>s. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given that Solid provides a way for personal data to be stored and managed by individuals, it is important to consider the impact and application of data protection and privacy laws such as the GDPR that define specific concepts and obligations for how personal data can be collected, stored, used, and shared. In particular, GDPR's Articles 13 and 14 require that entities processing personal data provide transparent information on identity, purpose for processing, personal data categories, legal basis, recipients and so on, when they use personal data directly or indirectly obtained from individuals.</p>
    <p>Neither WAC nor ACP provide the terms to deal with these requirements. To overcome this issue, PLASMA promotes the usage of the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which is a W3C standard for policy expression and provides a convenient extension mechanism, through ODRL profiles, that can be integrated into the Solid architecture. Since ODRL is a general policy language, to invoke data protection-specific terms, the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) can be used. DPV provides a rich set of taxonomies that can be used to specify purposes, personal data types, technical and organisational measures, rights, risks or entities. The ODRL profile for Access Control (OAC) [] already integrates these two resources to manage access control to Solid Pods' resources and uses ACLs access modes, i.e., <code>acl:Read</code>, <code>acl:Write</code> and <code>acl:Append</code>, when possible to express the level of access to be permitted or prohibited, as well as DPV's taxonomies to express policies over particular types of data, to express constraints over purposes, recipients or legal basis and so on.</p>
    <p>The following sub-sections contain a set of examples that use OAC to specify <code>UserPreference</code>s, <code>UserRequirement</code>s, <code>UserOffer</code>s, <code>DataRequest</code>s and <code>DataAgreement</code>s as ODRL policies.</p>

        <li><code>User</code> needs to get an identity document through a <code>IdentityProvider</code> and keep a <code>IdentityLog</code> regarding the identity provision.</li>
